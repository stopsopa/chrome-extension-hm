# Privacy Policy for Header Modifier Extension

## No Data Collection

**This extension does not collect any data whatsoever.**

Header Modifier is designed with privacy in mind and:

- Does not track your browsing activity
- Does not collect personal information
- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools
- Does not generate any telemetry

## Local Storage Only

All configuration data (custom headers, rules, and settings) is stored locally on your device using the browser's built-in storage API. This data:

- Never leaves your browser
- Is not accessible to me as the extension developer
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Is completely under your control

## Permissions

The Header Modifier extension requires certain permissions to function:

- **declarativeNetRequest**: Used to modify HTTP headers in outgoing requests
- **storage**: Used to save your configuration and settings locally
- **host permissions**: Required to modify headers for websites you visit

These permissions are used solely for the core functionality of modifying HTTP headers as configured by you, and not for collecting or transmitting any data.
