# Privacy Justifications for Chrome Extension

## Single Purpose Description

Header Modifier is a powerful browser extension that allows you to customize HTTP request headers for all your web interactions. Whether you're a developer testing APIs, need to add authentication headers, or want to modify browser fingerprints, this tool gives you complete control over outgoing HTTP headers.

## Permissions Justifications

### declarativeNetRequest

This extension uses the declarativeNetRequest permission to modify HTTP headers in outgoing requests. This permission is essential for the core functionality of the extension, which is to add or modify HTTP headers based on user-defined rules. The declarativeNetRequest API allows the extension to perform these modifications efficiently without accessing or exposing sensitive user data, as it operates at the network request level rather than accessing page content.

### Host Permission

Host permissions for "<all_urls>" are required to modify headers for any website the user visits, ensuring the header modification functionality works across all domains without restrictions. This is essential for the core functionality as users may need to add custom headers for any website.

### Storage

Storage permission is needed to save user preferences, custom header configurations, and rule sets between browser sessions. This allows users to maintain their header modification settings after closing and reopening the browser.

## Data Usage Compliance

This extension complies with all Chrome Web Store Developer Program Policies regarding data collection and usage. User data is processed locally within the browser and is not transmitted to any external servers. The extension only modifies outgoing request headers based on user-defined rules and does not collect, store, or share any browsing data or personal information.

Key features:

- Add or modify HTTP headers in outgoing requests
- Apply headers globally or to specific URLs using pattern matching
- User-friendly interface with real-time header management
- No data collection - all operations happen locally in your browser
